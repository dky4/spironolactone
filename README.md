# Spironolactone
This is a tool meant for booting dualboots, ssh ramdisks, and tether downgrades for now.

Expansion in functionality (i.e. installing dualboots, jailbreaks, downgrades, etc) willl come at a later date. 

We also have a discord server at https://discord.gg/tXBqy3FRUP for updates and discussion
I will annunce updates over at https://x.com/_orangera1n 
# Important information
1. This tool is in VERY early stages of development, meaning that various functionailites might not be implemented or are otherwise buggy.
2. By using this tool, you will almost certainly wiping the device, back up any data beforehand.
3. This tool, for iOS 12 atleast, has all the seprmvr64 restrictions, meaning that you should not use it for a main device.

Do *not* ask for an ETA for this project.
# Prerequsites
1. A computer running macOS (Linux is untested, but is likely easy to implement, Windows is *very* unlikely)
2. A usbliter8 compatible devices (A12, A13)
- Note that A12X/Z is not implemented due to lack of offsets, and S4/S5 will likely not be implemented due to tooling reasons and lack of demand.
3. Common sense
4. An rp2350-based development board, I recommend the Waveshare RP2350A USB Mini
